DooDoo is a task management app I built in one week for Module 2 of Ironhack. It is intended to be used by anyone for any reason whatsoever. The overall purpose of DooDoo is to keep track of appointments, build grocery lists, study, set a workflow for projects, etc. Pretty much anything! Although very minimal at this point, I intend to further build on it and improve it by implementing new features and making it more interactive on the front-end.
